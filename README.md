# MySQL e-commerce

For this project, I followed along a course which simulates a hypothetical e-commerce company. 

The [code]() shows how to look for the answers to the questions asked by the CEO, Website Manager and other members of this company. 

NOTES ABOUT DATABASE
The database starts from March 2012 (the poduct launch date).
utm NULL suggests utm source tracker not put in place or not from utm source.
I use 'created_at' to simulate a timeline for this growing company, as if I am working there. 

In addition, there's also a [mid-term project]() where I summarise how the company has been performing for the first 6 months. This includes convertion rates, webiste test analysis and showcasing profit. I then visualised the findings [here]() in Tableua to be presented to the board members.
